# Movie-Trailer-Project
My first project for Udacity (hopefully not the last)
#MY FAVOURITE TV SHOWS

This Python application will generate a dynamic webpage featuring my personal favourite TV shows.

#Installation
In order to run this, you need to install **Python** on your machine. You can proceed to [download it](http://www.python.org)

Once you **have installed Python**, proceed to downloading the three files `tvbase.py`, `tvshow.py` and `website.py`. Make sure to save them in **one folder**. Once you have done that, proceed to open the file named `tvbase.py` one of the following ways:

a)	Open _IDLE_, go to _File / Open /_ … choose the destination where you’ve saved this folder, and choose `tvbase.py`

b)	Navigate to _tvbase.py_, right click, _“Open with “, IDLE_

Once the file is open in IDLE, simply push _“Run”_ on the toolbar.

#Functionality
Hovering over the image area for the TV show, you can see the storyline.

Clicking anywhere in the highlighted area, you will see a trailer for the show.

#Enjoy
